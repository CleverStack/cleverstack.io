    |  approach to 
    strong
      i modules
    | , that was designed with three goals in mind; 
    strong

    | , 
    strong
      i simplicity
    | , and 
    strong
      i re-usability
    |  - as best practice, all functionality including what is in the CleverStack Core should be defined inside of modules.

    strong
      i on a horizontal scale
