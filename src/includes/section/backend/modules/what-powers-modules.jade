      i Module System
    |  provides a very thin abstraction layer ontop of NPM, which because of its very small core codebase is easy to maintain, has a very low risk of severe bugs, has community support for speedy bug fixes to reported or common issues, that fascilitates creating the most modular code possible when developing on the 
    strong NodeJS
    |  runtime, without sacrificing code quality or developer sanity.
