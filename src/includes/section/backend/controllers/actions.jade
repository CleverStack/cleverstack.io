    | When doing a GET /example it will route to either listAction first OR getAction if listAction is not defined.
    br
    |   If neither are defined, express's .next() function will be called allowing it to fall through the controller and move onto any other middleware you may have configured.
    br
    |   If you want /example/hello as a route, you can simply implement helloAction in your controller and it will be automatically routed to it.

    h4 Standard for defining actions
    p
      | This is the default way to setup a controller to use actions. By default you can also visit /example/12 and it will route to the getAction function in your controller (if it's defined) with this.req.params.id set for you to use (the same applies for all HTTP methods, eg PUT/DELETE/POST/et cetera)
