  <!-- Overview

      <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Developers all over the world for years have been striving to be able to create smarter, smaller, easier to manage, faster to develop, re-usable chunks of code that are as modular as possible without sacrificing code quality or developer sanity.</p>

    <p>CleverStack set out to accomplish this and create the worlds first Modular Full Stack JS Framework, with the Architecture designed by <a href="https://github.com/pilsy">Richard Gustin</a> and his role as Lead working with a <a href="/about/#team">group of highly skilled developers</a> we believe that we accomplished this task.</p>

    <p>What this mean's for you is, you are able to create smaller, more specific modules that are extremely powerful, completely self contained and can be used between many projects. If you believe your module is useful you can publish your module to the CleverStack EcoSystem through NPM (Backend) or Bower (Frontend).</p>

  <!-- Testing
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">At Clevertech we believe in testing our code as we develop, then if something breaks we know exactly where to start looking. Spending more time on developing the features we love.</p>

    <h3 id="testing-unit">Running Unit Tests</h3>
    <p>To run the unit tests for your app and modules, from the front-end/back-end root directory run:</p>
    {% highlight bash %}$ clever test unit{% endhighlight %}
    <p>Or simply use the alias:</p>
    {% highlight bash %}$ clever test{% endhighlight %}

    <h3 id="testing-e2e">Running E2E Tests</h3>
    <p>To setup your environment for e2e testing with Protractor run the following command. This will install Selenium Server (WebDriver), ChromeDriver & PhantomJS based on your OS. If you wish to run selenium server in a separate terminal then use Webdriver Manager (see below).</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd Frontend
$ npm run-script setup-protractor
{% endhighlight %}

    <h3>Using Webdriver Manager</h3>
    <p>Webdriver Manager comes shipped with protractor and installs selenium server & chrome driver for you. Selenium server can then run in a separate terminal so when you run your e2e tests it doesn't need to boot up (saving heaps of time when running your e2e tests!). To set this up do the following:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g protractor
webdriver-manager update
webdriver-manager start
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Your selenium server should be running in this terminal.</p>
    <p>Finally update your e2e test config file located: my-app/Frontend/test-e2e.conf.js</p>
{% highlight bash %}
// uncomment this line:
seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',

// comment these lines:
seleniumServerJar: ''
seleniumPort: ''
chromeDriver: ''
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>To run the end-to-end tests for your app and modules, from the front-end/back-end root directory run:</p>
    {% highlight bash %}$ clever test e2e{% endhighlight %}

    <h3 id="testing-coverage">Code Coverage Reports</h3>
    <p>To generate a code coverage report for your unit tests, from the front-end directory run:</p>
    {% highlight bash %}$ clever test coverage{% endhighlight %}
    <p>Your browser should open the following URL:</p>
    {% highlight bash %}$ http://localhost:5555{% endhighlight %}
    <p>Then select your report from the list.</p>

  <!-- Deployment
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">At Clevertech we build lots of MVP's so we like our deployment to be as efficient as possible. We are going to implement some of these strategies for CleverStack.</p>

    <h3 id="deployment-build">Production Builds</h3>
    <p>To build a production version of your front-end app, from your front-end root directory run:</p>
    {% highlight bash %}$ clever build{% endhighlight %}
    <p>This will build your app, minifying your assets etc and puts everything into the /dist folder ready for deployment.</p>
    <p>Note: You can view a production version of your app on port 9009.</p>

    <h3 id="deployment-strategies">Deployment Strategies</h3>
    <p>Stay Tuned!! NodeJS deployment strategies coming soon. AWS, Heroku and more.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>EMFILE error on Mac: By default some macs have a ulimit of 256 which limits the number of open files each process can have, when using "clever init my-app" you will need to raise your ulimit by running "ulimit -n 1024" in your console. You will need to run that in your console before running the init command unless you define that setting globally in your mac.</li>
