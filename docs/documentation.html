    <p class="lead">Developers all over the world for years have been striving to be able to create smarter, smaller, easier to manage, faster to develop, re-usable chunks of code that are as modular as possible without sacrificing code quality or developer sanity.</p>

    <p>CleverStack set out to accomplish this and create the worlds first Modular Full Stack JS Framework, with the Architecture designed by <a href="https://github.com/pilsy">Richard Gustin</a> and his role as Lead working with a <a href="/about/#team">group of highly skilled developers</a> we believe that we accomplished this task.</p>

    <p>What this mean's for you is, you are able to create smaller, more specific modules that are extremely powerful, completely self contained and can be used between many projects. If you believe your module is useful you can publish your module to the CleverStack EcoSystem through NPM (Backend) or Bower (Frontend).</p>
