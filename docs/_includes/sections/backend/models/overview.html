<p class="lead">CleverStack comes with a robust and enterprise grade flexible ORM &amp; ODM, that provides database agnostic models that greatly simplifies interaction with one or more databases/servers. That mean's you're focused on your data structures and their relationships, instead of worrying about vendor specific code and implementation details.

  <h6>I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.</h6>

<p>No matter what database your communicating with you can Create, Query, and Manipulate your data without writing any vendor/database specific integration code; The syntax for Querying, Creating, Updating or Destroying models is exactly the same. That mean's you can switch any of your app's model's from MySQL, to Mongo, to PostgreSQL, to MSSQL and back again - <strong><i>without changing any code</i></strong>.</p>

<p>To encourage and support <strong><i>Rapid Application Development</i></strong>, CleverStack is designed to be <strong><i>Convention over Configuration</i></strong>, so we use <strong><i>sane</i></strong>, <strong><i>best practice</i></strong>, <i>conventions</i>, that are <strong><i>fleixble</i></strong> enough to allow you to <strong><i>configure every option</i></strong> if you need to, meaning there are no drawbacks or limitations imposed, just benefits.</p>

<p></p>And for those times when you need low-level, database-specific functionality, CleverStack provides a query interface that allow's you to talk directly to your model's underlying database server through the use of raw and native queries.</p>

<p>Because we use SequelizeJS &amp; MongooseJS for the eventual persistence of data, that gives us the features, support and stability that comes from these mature NodeJS Packages. Our Abstraction Layer manages the internal usage of these npm packages to allow you to define a single model definition regardless of what database (or Databases) you choose to use (or change at any time). That mean's your models are flexible and pain free to write, maintain, and use.</p>

<p>To make querying/searching your data as simple as possible, <a href="#finders-dynamic">Dynamic Finders</a> are automatically generated for every <a href="#field-definition">Field</a> based on their name. For example if we had a field named <code>firstName</code> on the <code>UserModel</code>, one of the dynamic finders for this field will be <code>UserModel.findByFirstName</code> - please see <a href="#finders-dynamic">Dynamic Finders</a> for more information.</p>

<p>To find information about defining models please see <a href="#definition">Model Definition</a>, <a href="#field-definition">Field Definition</a> and <a href="#field-types">Field Types</a>.</p>
