<p>Controllers are the thing that directly responds to each HTTP Request that comes into your application, as such each web request will result in (if routed) a new instance of a Controller (Class).</p>
<p>Avoid callback soup/hell and promise slowdown by using this.proxy() or this.callback() in the Static section of the Controller, this keeps code nesting to a minimum and brings code re-use up. Instead of passing around req and res as arguments like other less organized solutions, in CleverStack they are exposed as this.req and this.res</p>
