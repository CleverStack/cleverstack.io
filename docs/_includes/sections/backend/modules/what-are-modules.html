<p class="lead">
  A Module is similar to a plugin in other software, or an npm package, but even better. The key difference is that Modules are first-class citizens, and everything is a Module in CleverStack, including both the core framework functionality and the code written for your application.
</p>

<p class="sub lead">
  A Module is simply a structured set of files within a directory that implement a single feature. You might create a blog-module, a forum-module or a users-module for user management. (many of these exist already as <a href="http://cleverstack.io/modules/">open source modules</a>).
</p>

<p class="sub lead">
  Each directory contains everything related to that feature, including all of it's classes, controllers, services, models, tasks, configuration, utils (both lib and grunt/gulp), seed data, e2e &amp; unit testing, and defines all dependencies in it's own package.json file. Every aspect of a feature exists in a module and every feature lives in a module.
</p>

<p class="sub lead">
  CleverStack makes it easy to pick and choose which features to enable in your application and gives you the freedom to optimize them the way you want!
