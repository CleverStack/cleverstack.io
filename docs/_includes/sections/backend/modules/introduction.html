  CleverStack introduces a <strong><i>new and powerful</i></strong> approach to <strong><i>modules</i></strong>, that was designed with three goals in mind; <strong><i>flexibility</i></strong>, <strong><i>simplicity</i></strong>, and <strong><i>re-usability</i></strong> - as best practice, all functionality except what is in the CleverStack Core should be defined inside of modules.
</p>

<p class="lead sub">
  CleverStack removes the complexity of installing &amp; configuring modules and makes developing modules easier (vertical scale), and allows you to be able to re-use modules with little or no code change between projects. (horizontal scale, using the CLI).
