  CleverStack introduces a <strong><i>new and powerful</i></strong> approach to <strong><i>modules</i></strong>, that was designed with three goals in mind; <strong><i>flexibility</i></strong>, <strong><i>simplicity</i></strong>, and <strong><i>re-usability</i></strong> - as best practice, all functionality including what is in the CleverStack Core should be defined inside of modules.
</p>

<p class="lead sub">
  <i>CleverStack <strong>removes the complexity</strong> from installing &amp; configuring modules, makes <strong>developing modules easier</strong> (vertical scale), and allows you to easily <strong>re-use modules</strong> with little or no code change <strong>between projects</strong>. (horizontal scale).</i>
</p>

<p class="lead sub">
  CleverStack encourages developers to shift their thinking and minset towards not only viewing the modularization principles <strong><i>on a vertical scale</i></strong>, (e.g. reducing developing time), but also <strong><i>on a horizontal scale</i></strong>. (e.g. not needing to focus on every single detail, being able to take a step back and look at your environment across the horizon).
