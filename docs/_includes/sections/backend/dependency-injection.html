<h3 class="page-header" id="backend-di">Dependency Injection<br>
<small>Asynchronous and fully Non-blocking dependency injection for Node (based on AngularJS)</small></h3>

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Non-blocking and fully async</li>
  <li>Load's resources based upon name for you and injects dependencies</li>
  <li>Will never load the same resource more than once, it uses the one singular instance for all dependencies</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>CleverStack Controllers, Services, Routes, Models and Tests are loaded and all of their dependencies are loaded and injected automatically using the <a href="https://github.com/cleverstack/clever-injector">CleverStack Dependency Injection</a> module.</p>

<p>When resources/files are loaded using the injector it will automatically load and inject any of it's dependencies in a recursive manner.</p>

<p>Simply put the name of the dependency you need in the function exported by the file and it will be loaded and injected for you automatically.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = function( SomeDependency ) {
  // SomeDependency is loaded and injected into this function for you
}
