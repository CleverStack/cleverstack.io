<p>
  When doing a GET /example it will route to either listAction first OR getAction if listAction is not defined.<br>
  If neither are defined, express's .next() function will be called allowing it to fall through the controller and move onto any other middleware you may have configured.<br>
  If you want /example/hello as a route, you can simply implement helloAction in your controller and it will be automatically routed to it.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <h4>Standard for defining actions</h4>
  <p>This is the default way to setup a controller to use actions. By default you can also visit /example/12 and it will route to the getAction function in your controller (if it's defined) with this.req.params.id set for you to use (the same applies for all HTTP methods, eg PUT/DELETE/POST/et cetera)</p>
