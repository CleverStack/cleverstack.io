<p class="lead sub">The main aim of the controller is to help simplify the most common tasks that you need to do when setting up routes and functions/classes to handle them.</p>

<p>Controllers are the thing that directly responds to each HTTP Request that comes into your application, as such each web request will result in (if routed) a new instance of a Controller (Class).</p>
<p>Avoid callback soup/hell and promise slowdown by using this.proxy() or this.callback() in the Static section of the Controller, this keeps code nesting to a minimum and brings code re-use up. Instead of passing around req and res as arguments like other less organized solutions, in CleverStack they are exposed as this.req and this.res</p>

<h5 class="page-header">Highlights</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Lightning fast</li>
  <li>V8's Hidden Classes &amp; Inline Caches</li>
  <li>V8's Optimizing Compiler which generates efficient machine code to run in place of your javascript</li>
  <li>Clean, Efficient and Optimized code</li>
  <li>Super methods</li>
  <li>Static inheritance</li>
  <li>Prototypal inheritance</li>
  <li>Setup and initialization methods for both Static and Prototype</li>
  <li>Easy-to-use method proxys with currying ( Static.callback() and Prototype.proxy() )</li>
  <li>Internet Addressable functions, simply add 'Action' to the end of your controllers method() name and it will be Internet Addressable (as long as a route points to that controller).</li>
  <li>Private functions, any function without 'Action' on the end of its name is NOT Internet Addressable</li>
  <li>Easy accessors for Request and Response, available as this.req and this.res.</li>
</ul>
